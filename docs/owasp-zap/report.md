### [ Content Security Policy (CSP) Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10038/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks. These attacks are used for everything from data theft to site defacement or distribution of malware. CSP provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to declare approved sources of content that browsers should be allowed to load on that page — covered types are JavaScript, CSS, HTML frames, fonts, images and embeddable objects such as Java applets, ActiveX, audio and video files.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that your web server, application server, load balancer, etc. is configured to set the Content-Security-Policy header.

### [ Cross-Domain Misconfiguration ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10098/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

Web browser data loading may be possible, due to a Cross Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) misconfiguration on the web server.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *`
  * Other Info: `The CORS misconfiguration on the web server permits cross-domain read requests from arbitrary third party domains, using unauthenticated APIs on this domain. Web browser implementations do not permit arbitrary third parties to read the response from authenticated APIs, however. This reduces the risk somewhat. This misconfiguration could be used by an attacker to access data that is available in an unauthenticated manner, but which uses some other form of security, such as IP address white-listing.`
* URL: http://localhost:3000/css/bootstrap.min.css
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/css/bootstrap.min.css`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``

Instances: Systemic


### Solution

Ensure that sensitive data is not available in an unauthenticated manner (using IP address white-listing, for instance).
Configure the "Access-Control-Allow-Origin" HTTP header to a more restrictive set of domains, or remove all CORS headers entirely, to allow the web browser to enforce the Same Origin Policy (SOP) in a more restrictive manner.

#### WASC Id: 14

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Missing Anti-clickjacking Header ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10020/)



##### Medium (Medium)

### Description

The response does not protect against 'ClickJacking' attacks. It should include either Content-Security-Policy with 'frame-ancestors' directive or X-Frame-Options.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `x-frame-options`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Modern Web browsers support the Content-Security-Policy and X-Frame-Options HTTP headers. Ensure one of them is set on all web pages returned by your site/app.
If you expect the page to be framed only by pages on your server (e.g. it's part of a FRAMESET) then you'll want to use SAMEORIGIN, otherwise if you never expect the page to be framed, you should use DENY. Alternatively consider implementing Content Security Policy's "frame-ancestors" directive.

### [ Sub Resource Integrity Attribute Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90003/)



##### Medium (High)

### Description

The integrity attribute is missing on a script or link tag served by an external server. The integrity tag prevents an attacker who have gained access to this server from injecting a malicious content.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: `<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Lato&display=swap" rel="stylesheet" />`
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Provide a valid integrity attribute to the tag.

#### WASC Id: 15

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header is a response header that prevents a document from loading any cross-origin resources that don't explicitly grant the document permission (using CORP or CORS).

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header to 'require-corp' for documents.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Embedder-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-embedder-policy).

#### WASC Id: 14

#### Source ID: 3

### [ Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy Header Missing or Invalid ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/90004/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header is a response header that allows a site to control if others included documents share the same browsing context. Sharing the same browsing context with untrusted documents might lead to data leak.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: `Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy`
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: ``


Instances: 1

### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header appropriately, and that it sets the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header to 'same-origin' for documents.
'same-origin-allow-popups' is considered as less secured and should be avoided.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that supports the Cross-Origin-Opener-Policy header (https://caniuse.com/mdn-http_headers_cross-origin-opener-policy).

### [ Permissions Policy Header Not Set ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10063/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

Permissions Policy Header is an added layer of security that helps to restrict from unauthorized access or usage of browser/client features by web resources. This policy ensures the user privacy by limiting or specifying the features of the browsers can be used by the web resources. Permissions Policy provides a set of standard HTTP headers that allow website owners to limit which features of browsers can be used by the page such as camera, microphone, location, full screen etc.

### [ X-Content-Type-Options Header Missing ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10021/)



##### Low (Medium)

### Description

The Anti-MIME-Sniffing header X-Content-Type-Options was not set to 'nosniff'. This allows older versions of Internet Explorer and Chrome to perform MIME-sniffing on the response body, potentially causing the response body to be interpreted and displayed as a content type other than the declared content type. Current (early 2014) and legacy versions of Firefox will use the declared content type (if one is set), rather than performing MIME-sniffing.

* URL: http://localhost:3000
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000`

Instances: Systemic


### Solution

Ensure that the application/web server sets the Content-Type header appropriately, and that it sets the X-Content-Type-Options header to 'nosniff' for all web pages.
If possible, ensure that the end user uses a standards-compliant and modern web browser that does not perform MIME-sniffing at all, or that can be directed by the web application/web server to not perform MIME-sniffing.

### [ Storable and Cacheable Content ](https://www.zaproxy.org/docs/alerts/10049/)



##### Informational (Medium)

### Description

The response contents are storable by caching components such as proxy servers, and may be retrieved directly from the cache, rather than from the origin server by the caching servers, in response to similar requests from other users. If the response data is sensitive, personal or user-specific, this may result in sensitive information being leaked. In some cases, this may even result in a user gaining complete control of the session of another user, depending on the configuration of the caching components in use in their environment. This is primarily an issue where "shared" caching servers such as "proxy" caches are configured on the local network. This configuration is typically found in corporate or educational environments, for instance.

* URL: http://localhost:3000/robots.txt
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/robots.txt`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`
* URL: http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
  * Node Name: `http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml`
  * Method: `GET`
  * Parameter: ``
  * Attack: ``
  * Evidence: ``
  * Other Info: `In the absence of an explicitly specified caching lifetime directive in the response, a liberal lifetime heuristic of 1 year was assumed. This is permitted by rfc7234.`


Instances: 2

### Solution

Validate that the response does not contain sensitive, personal or user-specific information. If it does, consider the use of the following HTTP response headers, to limit, or prevent the content being stored and retrieved from the cache by another user:
Cache-Control: no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, private
Pragma: no-cache
Expires: 0
This configuration directs both HTTP 1.0 and HTTP 1.1 compliant caching servers to not store the response, and to not retrieve the response (without validation) from the cache, in response to a similar request.
